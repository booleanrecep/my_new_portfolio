    "bio":"Since 2011 I am a Turkish Teacher. But in the eve of 2017 I put a goal: to learn programming. After searching a little bit I found a book about Python. I was reading it with always awake curiosity. I finished it in 2 months. With this book I felt in love with software knowledge. I was angry with myself why so far I just stuck at formatting computers and playing PC games! Later on I found courses in ISMEK (Istanbul Municipality Free Courses). I felt like ı found a boat in a stranded island. The courses I took: Python, WordPress, Oracle, HTML, CSS, JavaScript. In the meantime I joined Artificial Intelligence Course given by Sarıyer Municipality. I have got general information about data analyses, Twitter sentiment analyses, NLP. And I joined some Kaggle competitions. After that I found inzva community. I accepted their AI Project program. With a team of 5 people we tried to understand how bipedal-walker agent can learn and be thought to walk with reinforcement learning algorithm. In the end I felt I was scattering myself. Software is like an ocean and with the love of learning I was over-drinking from that ocean. So I decided to focus on and follow one way which I can really do: front-end development. In September of 2019 I applied to Front-end Development with React course which is provided by great NGO Re:Coded. The curriculum was consisted of Git, GitHub, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js. In a 5 months of intense learning I successfully completed the course. In the end we made a real project with a team of 8 people.While doing this project we intensely used Git, GitLab, Slack, Notion, agile methodology. I know that learning is not a destination but a unending process. Especially in software. I am still in this process and trying to upgrade myself by staying up to date. ",
